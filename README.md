## ðŸ“Š Datasets

### 1. Study Hours vs Score
- **Description:** This dataset contains the number of hours studied by students and the corresponding exam scores.  
- **Columns:**
  - `hours`: Number of hours studied.
  - `score`: Exam score (out of 100).  
- **Purpose:** Predict the exam score based on study hours using linear regression.  
- **Graph:** A scatter plot with `hours` on the X-axis and `score` on the Y-axis shows the positive relationship between study hours and scores.

### 2. House Price (Size_m2 vs Price)
- **Description:** Contains house sizes in square meters and their corresponding prices.  
- **Columns:**
  - `size_m2`: Size of the house in square meters.
  - `price`: House price in local currency.  
- **Purpose:** Predict house prices based on house size using linear regression.  
- **Graph:** A scatter plot with `size_m2` on the X-axis and `price` on the Y-axis shows a positive correlation between size and price.

### 3. Salary vs Experience
- **Description:** Contains employee experience in years and their corresponding salary.  
- **Columns:**
  - `experience_years`: Number of years of experience.
  - `salary_k`: Salary in thousands.  
- **Purpose:** Predict salary based on experience using linear regression.  
- **Graph:** A scatter plot with `experience_years` on the X-axis and `salary_k` on the Y-axis shows a trend of increasing salary with experience.

## ðŸ”§ Usage
You can use these datasets to:
- Train simple linear regression models.
- Visualize relationships between independent and dependent variables.
- Evaluate model performance using metrics such as MSE, RMSE, and RÂ².
